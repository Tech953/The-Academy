# The-Academy
A Text Adventure RPG


Welcome to “The Academy”, an esteemed private school located in the far reaches of Toronto, Canada. You are the “new kid”, a freshman who just arrived from places unknown, to a place even more unknown. Prepare for a mysterious new environment to explore and live in, where every step you take is an imprint, every word you speak ripples out into its halls, and every corner promises a trip into the void of space itself. Align yourself, arm your body and mind, and prepare for the future. Not even your dorm room can protect you from the darkness, after all.

This game will feature an active class system, involving a freely formed syllabus program for multiple playthroughs, and a flexible social network that contains the building of friendships, relationships, rivalships, and faction related reputation. This system is interacted with through a multi-choiced conversation system, which includes a multifaceted conversation tree.

After you have finished the game, keep your most recent save to prepare for the next step in your adventure, which enables you to transfer over your player character into the sequel: <University.Self>
